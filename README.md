## Motivation
This project was supposed to be my first attempt at unguided development. Prior to starting this project I had been learning Java in university for about
a year. I hope to gain some confidence in my software development skills, a better understanding of Java and the libraries it has to offer (in particular 
JavaFX) and to grasp basic git workflows.
